description: We developed a Sudoku solver capable of solving puzzles from images using various image processing filters. This project served as a platform for learning and mastering the C language, a staple in computer science, and delving into the realm of artificial intelligence, a previously unexplored territory for us. It also provided valuable experience in image manipulation.

I actively contributed to the creation of a Sudoku solver, a project that involved developing a system capable of solving Sudoku puzzles from images of unsolved ones. Multiple filters were applied to facilitate the resolution process. This endeavor provided a unique learning experience and a chance to refine our C programming skills while exploring the fascinating world of artificial intelligence, previously unfamiliar to us. Additionally, it allowed us to gain proficiency in image manipulation techniques.
