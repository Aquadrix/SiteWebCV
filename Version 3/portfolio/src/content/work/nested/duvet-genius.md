I actively contributed to the design of a unique vending machine, an enriching experience that began with the challenge of creating a personal-use vending machine, a completely new concept for me.

The design of this vending machine took an entirely manual approach, with the goal of making it as cost-effective as possible. A key decision was not to draw inspiration from existing projects, thus preserving our creativity.

This experience provided an opportunity to apply my skills in design and problem-solving, contributing to the creation of a vending machine that combines ingenuity and originality.
